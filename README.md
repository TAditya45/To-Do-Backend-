# To-Do-Backend-
A To-Do list backend code which  is written using the Flask 


python version as of now Python 3.9.0

To run application   
  First we need a desired front end  with the API's.
  As of now in the code i used the normal api methods not a specific url.
  The code written is for storing the data in CSV file so the program is going  to take care about that.
  If  we use database then we need to download the dependencies respected to it and apart from that the system should have python installed.
